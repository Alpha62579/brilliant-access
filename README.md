# Brilliant Proctored Exam Access Code Finder

```
Dear Brilliant,
  I must express my profound gratitude for the sheer brilliance
  of your decisions regarding exams. When the exams were offline,
  I couldn't visit home without missing an exam and eventually
  getting questioned for not attending it, thanks to your remarkable
  commitment to inconvenience. Now, even with the convenience
  of online exams, my class teacher seems surprisingly irked by
  my choice to take them from the comfort of my home.

  During the Model Test Series, you graciously made exams fully
  online. Such progress! However, there's a delightful twist â€”
  I still have the privilege of writing these exams in my school's
  computer lab. It's annoying, but hey, who doesn't love a good
  inconvenience?

  On a day when I felt under the weather, I thought, "Let's skip
  today's exam and get some well-deserved rest." Little did I know,
  my class teacher decided to turn into my personal life coach,
  calling the hostel warden to ensure I attended the exam. What a
  thoughtful gesture! Now, I'm not only unwell but also incredibly
  annoyed.

  Given that hostel life is already a joy, I appreciate your efforts
  to make it even more delightful by forcing me into situations like
  this. Perhaps you haven't had enough of my escapades, like fully
  unlocking your "locked" study tablets?

  In conclusion, kudos to you for consistently finding new ways to
  make my life more interesting and challenging. I eagerly await
  your next ingenious move.

Sincerely,
A Computer Science student.
