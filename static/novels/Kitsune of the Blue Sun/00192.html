It won’t happen again.””</p><p>“Good. Now get out here, I have another mission for you.” (Keeno)</p><p>The Rune tattoos on my arms glowed and the two hellhounds jumped out, kneeling.</p><p>“Gather up some Death Spirits and hide in my shadow. We are going to a ball soon and there are going to be several people marked for death. I want them followed for now and only killed when I give the order.” (Keeno)</p><p>““Understood.””</p><p>They sank into the shadows and their presence vanished.</p><p>“Thank you for not ordering a slaughter immediately.” (Margaret)</p><p>“Mm.  With my improved declaration earlier, I want to mess with them a bit.” (Keeno)</p><p>“Heh.  It’s going to be entertaining watching them fall all over themselves while trying not to offend you.” (Margaret)</p><p>“Indeed.  Though I would like to meet the one that tried to hit us with aphrodisiac in the room.  They’ll get special attention.” (Keeno)</p><p>“I won’t stop that one, they deserve it.” (Margaret)</p><p>A few more hours passed before a knock sounded on the door. After acknowledging the knocker, the door opened to reveal the noble that officiated the meeting earlier whose name I forgot.</p><p>“My ladies, the ball is beginning soon, and it would be I, Lord Ign Orant’s, pleasure to escort you to the venue.” (Ign)</p><p>I could see in his eyes that he was shocked at the smell in the room, and I could see the cold sweat breaking out all over his face.</p><p>“Pardon me, but by chance do the two of you feel alright?” (Ign)</p><p>“I feel a bit peckish, but other than that I am fine. What if you, Lady Nearl?” (Keeno)</p><p>“I am perfectly fine. A bit tired of this sweet-smelling room, but that’s about it.” (Margaret)</p><p>Though I assume he thought otherwise, the clear expression of disbelieving relief on his face made it clear he was not the one behind this room’s <em>amenities</em> .  We stood up and exited the room before the noble turned and, with a bow, led the way to the ball.  It was a very short walk before a set of, honestly, beautifully sculpted stone doors. The noble pushed them open and a sight I never expected to see in the middle of a desert appeared.</p><p>The thing that fist drew my eyes was a massive fountain burbling with clear water, statues of kitsune holding overflowing bowls with water flowing down the curvaceous bodies and onto stone carved trees which spread the water further until it finally landed in the bottom of the fountain which was made of a lapis lazuli basic. From the fountain several lines of palm trees spread in each direction. It was the most Life I had seen since arriving in Lokir.  Seeing the sight, I got a fun idea.</p><p>‘Huginn, Muninn, operation dramatic entrance.’ (Keeno)</p><p>As we walked down the row of palm trees to the fountain, I heard the low drum of music and the chattering of people. Just as we were about to enter the plaza, two shadows flew down from the night sky and landed on the palm trees. They both opened their four wings and let out a ghostly caw that echoed around the plaza and seemed to rattle the soul. All present looked at the trees where the two ravens sat and I alone walked between them. The flapped elegantly down from the trees and allowed me to pet their heads.</p><p>“I apologize for disturbing the festivities, but my little friends here love making an entrance.” (Keeno)</p><p>The silence following my words lasted for several moments before slow, uneasy claps followed. I played it off like I didn’t realize the strange mood and continued to walk toward the fountain.  As my steps echoed through the plaza with nothing but the burbling of the fountain to contest them the claps slowly fading out and the music of the performers beginning again. I glanced at my two feathered friends, and they flew away into the night sky, which drastically improved the mood around us.</p><p>‘Note for future me, Huginn and Muninn seem to have an aura that makes people uneasy.’ (Keeno)</p><p>{Well, as Heralds of Death, it makes sense. Though with that it’s fitting all the people here saw them.}</p><p>‘Well, I hope that fox lady didn’t see them, she isn’t marked for now.’ (Keeno)</p><p>{It’ll be fine.}</p><p>Slowly the chatter began again, and Margaret arrived at my side before the wave of nobles fully regained their senses.</p><p>‘I believe you should find Lady Sif before things get annoying for you.’ (Margaret)</p><p>‘I agree.’ (Keeno)</p><p>I admired the fountain for a few more minutes before turning and looking over the attendees.  While most were chatting happily with their fellow nobles, it was clear they were all keeping at least one eye on me or in my direction. It seemed my little display with Huginn and Muninn didn’t curb their ambitions as much as I’d hoped.  A few tried to approach me but they were skillfully dissuaded by Margaret.  I wasn’t lucky enough to avoid all of them, however. Most of them, surprisingly, only wished to greet me and offered to invite me to tea or a meal at their homes before walking away to socialize more, though some were pushier than others.</p><p>It was only after wading through all of that did, I see the kitsune woman I was looking for.  She was a head shorter than me with long blond hair and a similarly golden tail ending in a tuft of white.  Though I assumed it was just an act, everything about her screamed meek and sheltered.  Smiling to myself I slowly approached her. Noticing that she lightly blushed and half turned away from me.</p><p>[Sif POV]</p><p>So far it was turning out to be a boring ball. The most important guest hadn’t arrived yet and I was starting to worry that something had happened to her when she left the meeting hall earlier. Knowing some of these bastards as well as I did, I know at least one had to have done SOMETHING.  I just hoped it wouldn’t lead to a war we were unequipped to fight.  It was then that me and everyone else here felt an ominous pressure.</p><p>Turning to the west plaza entrance, two massive birds resembling ravens landed on the trees. The sound they made sent shivers down my spine and caused my tail to fluff out in panic. My attendant who wasn’t that far from me wobbled and I held her up so she wouldn’t fall. It was then that we heard the footsteps. Looking down I saw the Princess arrive. The birds flew down from the trees and landed next to her and she began patting their heads with a gentle smile on her face. She said something and they flew away, but I was too dazed to process what she said.</p><p>The Princess walked toward the embarrassing fountain in the center of the plaza while all those present recovered from the shock. Soon enough though, she was getting swarmed by nobles. Lady Nearl took the brunt of them and distracted them, though the Princess was still unlucky enough to be approached. Only after a while did the sea of people recede enough for her to breathe. It was then that I noticed she was looking around. When our eyes met she smiled and I felt my hear start beating faster.  I could feel my cheeks heat up and I turned away.</p><p>‘Why am I acting like such a child whose just met her first love?’</p><p>While I was losing myself in my thoughts, I didn’t notice when the Princess moved next to me.</p><p>“Hello there, are you perhaps free at the moment?” (Okami)</p><p>“Ah!  Y-yes, your highness.  I-I apologize for not greeting you sooner.” (Sif)</p><p>“Oh it’s quite alright. I didn’t have all that much of a chance to find you either. I have been wishing to speak with you since I saw you in that stuffy meeting hall earlier.” (Okami)</p><p>Her small, gentle smile and honest eyes made me blush again and I looked down in hopes of hiding it. When I did so my eyes landed on her hands and on the ring on one of her fingers.</p><p>“If I may, your highness, are you perhaps betrothed?” (Sif)</p><p>“I am actually married, though unfortunately my wife could not join me on my journey. Oh, how I miss her.” (Okami)</p><p>This answer shook me to my core.  Not only was she already married, but to another woman at that. Not that I had any right to question that, but I had brothers who could pass on my family name.  For a prospective queen to be married to a woman was unheard of.</p><p>“Is there something wrong?  Are you perhaps uncomfortable with that?” (Okami)</p><p>“Oh no, morning the slightest.  In fact, I have four wives myself, it just shocked me that as a future queen you would marry a woman and not a man to have heirs to the throne.” (Sif)</p><p>“Ah.  Well, I cannot have children, so there is no problem.” (Okami)</p><p>“Ah…my apologies.” (Sif)</p><p>“You have nothing to apologize for, little fox.  Now, while I would love to dive into a topic discussing my wife and I’m sure you’d love to do the same about yours, I have more important matters to discuss with you, though I’m not sure how much we should go into details here. Is there a time when you are free to meet later?” (Okami)</p><p>Her serious switch in tone brought me back to my senses. She is right, this isn’t the time to act as I have been.</p><p>“My apologies, it seems I’ve been a bit clumsy in my manners. As for your requested meeting, I can arrange a time and place, though I doubt the accommodations I can give you would be the most proper for someone of your status.” (Sif)</p><p>“I care not for that. The only ones who know my true identity are the nobles here and Lady Nearl’s knights. To the rest of the people, I am but an aspiring knight.” (Okami)</p><p>I nodded my head.  I was about to turn to my attendant but before I could she stepped up and handed me a folded piece of paper.</p><p>“Thank you.  Your Highness, this is the address of my abode. While I will have to check my schedule for the time, this is the place we can meet. Though I am sure you would like to meet at the compound of Lady Nearl’s Eclipse Knights, not many places are safe from the prying ears of others. My establishments are somewhat of a neutral zone from the various factions in this city, so any secret spoken is safe there.” (Sif)</p><p>“Thank you, Madam Sif.  I shall meet with you at your earliest convenience then.” (Okami)</p><p>She hid the paper away before smiling at me and my attendant.</p><p>“I believe I should take my leave now.  I cannot let Margaret handle all of these people by herself.” (Okami)</p><p>Just as she was turning away, one of the sleazier nobles approached, reeking of alcohol.</p><p>“Excuse me ladies, it seems your conversation is over. May I have some of your time, Princess?  Did you and your friend Lady Nearl like the room that my people prepared for you?”</p><p>He stepped between us, practically pushing me away and clinging to the Princess.  He lightly bowed and I thought he was reaching for her hand to place a kiss on it, but instead he grabbed a lock of loose hair and, with a knife neither of us saw him holding, cut said lock off. Me as well as many others froze in place as we watched this scene. Looking at the Princess’s face, her carefully maintained expression was gone, replaced with a rage that reminded me of blazing flames.  It made me fear for the souls of all present.</p><p>“State your name, noble.” (Okami)</p><p>“I am Lord Gonnadi, at your service.”</p><p>“Very well.  Die.” (Okami)</p><p>A sword appeared in the Princess’s hand. Its blade as black as night with blue flames that sparked orange on the edges and with strange golden symbols etched on the blade flashed through the air and shortly after the noble’s head was separated from his body.</p><p>The venue went silent as the now headless body teetered before falling limply to the ground. No blood spilled as the wounds were cauterized but the smell of burnt flesh began to fill the area.  As we all silently looked at the body, a black, muddy looking orb floated out of the body and flew toward the fountain. Before it could make contact with it, the sound of rattling chains was heard and the sword flew from Princess Omani’s hand, piercing the orb before returning to her hand once more.</p><p>“Hmph.  To think such a thing would happen only hours after my warning.  Should I take this as the stance of the rest of you?” (Okami)</p><p>No one moved.n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p><p>“Answer me!” (Okami)</p><p>The anger in her voice and the temperature around her increased. Which knocked several people into action, me being chief among them. I quickly knelt before her with my head bowed.</p><p>“No, your highness, that is not the stance the country of Lokir takes. We wish to keep friendly relations with you and deeply apologize for the behavior of our own. Though we cannot offer you his head as you’ve already taken it, we shall offer all of this one’s assets to you in reparations.” (Sif)</p><p>“Hmm. Very well, I’ll accept your words, Madam Sif, but know that you are the only reason I accept.  I won’t harm one of my own unless absolutely necessary, and as you are the only one so far, I’ve seen with no ulterior motive, so that gives me reason to trust your words.  BUT there won’t be a second time.  Margaret, let’s go, I’ve grown tired of this.” (Okami)</p><p>Sweeping her tails as she turned, she rubbed her hands through the hair that was cut as we all stared at the body of the idiot who almost ruined a chance at removing the ever-burning flames and the salvation of my people.  As soon as they were completely gone from the venue most everyone had snapped out of the shock.</p><p>“Good Lord Ign, please remove this trash from here then we must convene a second meeting to discuss our future steps.” (Sif)</p><p>“I agree, Madam Sif. Everyone!  The ball is over, as Madam Sif had said, we must hold an emergency meeting, so please reconvene in the meeting hall!” (Ign)</p><p>Everyone began to move toward other doors than the ones that the Princess entered and exited through while Lord Ign examined the corpse.</p><p>“Madam Sif, thank you for your courage in this moment of plight. If not for your quick thinking, then I fear we could have lost a most valuable asset.” (Ign)</p><p>“Mm.  I will not be present in this meeting. I must retire for the night after this experience, but please send a scribe’s report to me. Also, I suggest heeding her warnings, her magic, from what we saw earlier is one thing, but that sword she wielded, I’m assuming her Soul Weapon, filled me with a dread I’ve never felt before. Like I was staring Death itself in the face.” (Sif)</p><p>“Mmm.  I will take your words into account.” (Ign)</p><p>As I turned to leave, I saw Lord Ign take the lock of hair out of the dead man’s hand and stash it away in his own pocket.  I couldn’t help but let out a quiet sigh.</p><p>‘This fool is no different.’ (Sif)</p><p>I pulled my attendant along and we met up with my bodyguard in the hall before leaving to my carriage. I told my bodyguard what had transpired, and she pulled me close and snuggled me to calm me down.  My attendant also snuggled closer and placed her fluffy tail in my lap for me to hug.</p><p>“I love you both so much, I don’t deserve you.” (Sif)</p><p>“It’s us who should be saying that. If not for you, who knows what we’d be like or who’s whims we’d be under. I prefer you and your love over pretty much everything.” (Bodyguard)</p><p>“I agree. I’d much prefer being with you for all time than anything else in the world.” (Attendant)</p><p>“Hehehe.  Looks like you two want some spoiling tonight.” (Sif)</p><p>““We should be the ones spoiling you.””</p><p>Before I could reply, the two kissed my cheeks.  Unbeknownst to us, two wrathful goddesses were planning the obliteration of most of the nobles in this country with a fury as hot as the two suns.</p><p>Chaos Realm:</p><p>Luna: Let me at em!</p><p>…</p><p>Luna: Payto!</p><p>I’m tempted.</p><p>Luna: Eh!?</p><p>*Before Payto opens a portal for Luna he is hit in the head by a rock with a note tied to it*</p><p>Note: Payto, I’m monitoring you from here, don’t you dare do it. I know how you all feel cause even I’m mad, but I don’t think letting Luna loose will end well. And you still need to keep the pretense of impartiality. -Order</p><p>Tch.</p><p>*Payto gets hit with another rock*</p><p>Note: Don’t you ‘tch’ me.</p><p>Yes Order.  Please come home, I miss all of you.</p><p>*A feather drops into Payto’s lap*</p><p>Note: We’re almost done. After the wedding we can be together again, so just be a little more patient.</p><p>Astraea’s Addition: Don’t worry Papa, we’ll be home soon!</p><p>Nykuro’s Addition: And I’ll allow you to pat my head if you can wait a bit more.</p><p>Swii’s Addition: *sends pats through the note in form of emoticon*</p><p>Luna: …So no rampage?</p><p>No.</p><p>Luna: Awww.</p></main>
