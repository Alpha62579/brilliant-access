Yahello!

Here are some images I thought would be cool to set as the wallpaper.
Also some pdfs that may be useful although I don't think there's time to read through all that.

BTW, I set up an instance of Hextris at https://alpha62579.github.io/hextris for playing after the exam.

Update: i added a ~360 chapter long webnovel.

Signing off,
Robin.
