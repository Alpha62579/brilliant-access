Yahello!

Here are some images I thought would be cool to set as the wallpaper.
Also some Pdfs that may be useful although I don't think there's time to read through all that.

BTW, I set up an instance of Hextris at https://alpha62579.github.io/hextris for playing after the exam.

Signing off,
Robin.
